# data_products

This is my submission for Developping Data Product course on Coursera, week 4.

The submission consists of a Shiny app that illustrates in an interactive manner the behaviour of some machine learning algorithms.
The user can choose the shape of the train data, a type of model, set up some parameters depending on the model and see the fitted model applied on some test data 

The user can see the shape of the fitted function, identify the misclassified points.

The purpose is to understand that there is no free lunch and that the performance of predictive models also depend of the shape of the training data.
